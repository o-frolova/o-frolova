<h2 align=""> ✌️ Hello, I'm Frolova Olga</h2>
I currently has a bachelor's degree in spatial training "Applied Mathematics and Informatics", which I received at the National Research University Higher School of Economics. I actively study various aspects of mathematical modeling, statistics, algorithms and programming. In addition, I participated in projects to develop ML and DS solutions for business problems.
